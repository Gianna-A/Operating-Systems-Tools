# Operating-Systems-Tools

I developed this project for my university coursework in Operating Systems, using Java. 

It demonstrates the core operating system utilites including: 
- File operations (Task A): implements basic commands (similar to Linux).
- Memory management (Task B): Uses best-fit algorithms for memory management.
- TLB simulation (Task C): Simulates a translation-lookaside buffer.
